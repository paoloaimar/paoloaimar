Full stack developer specialized in industrial applications.

I currently work in the manufacturing sector, dealing in particular with the implementation and development of MES, IIoT, ERP and Data Warehousing solutions.
I mainly use Node.js or .NET Core frameworks for backend development and SAPUI5 and React as UI technology, but I am always ready and curious to learn new stacks.

Over the past few years, I had the possibility to get into cloud-oriented development approach, microservices application structure and major containerization and CI/CD techniques.
I have acquired a good experience in industrial IT, which allows me to be familiar with the principal patterns and best practices used in desktop-app and web-app development.
